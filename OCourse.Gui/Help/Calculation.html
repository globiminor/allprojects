    <p>
        To find the &quot;optimal&quot; route of a section, you would need to know the runner&#39;s velocity at each point in any direction having a defined previous velocity vector.<br />
        OCourse uses a simplified model, where the velocity a each point of an equally spaced grid is defined for up to 16 directions, independent of the previous velocity.
        The velocity in a point is defined by a <a href="#idHeightModel">height model</a>, a <a href="#idVelocityModel">velocity model</a> and a method to <a href="#idVelocityCalculator">calculate the velocity</a>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="idHeightModel">Height model</h4>
    The height model is defined by an esri ascii-grid file. This format is often provided by terrain model providers.
    The resolution of the grid should be reasonably small (1 to 2 meters).<br />

    <h4 id="idVelocityModel">Velocity model</h4>
    The velocity model is a tif-File with a georeference file, that can be derived from the obstructions in an OCAD map and specialiced symoblisation.
    <br />
    <img src="VelocityModel.png" /><br />
    The resolution of the image must be reasonably small. For a sprint map, a value &lt;= 0.5 meters is recommended.<br />
    The symbolisation can have to manners: Dependent on obstruction colors as colored image or directly as velocity quotion as gray level image.
    <h5>Colored image</h5>
    Following colors are allowed:
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <td>Color</td>
                <td>Description</td>
                <td>Velocity factor</td>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tr>
            <td>black</td>
            <td>road or path</td>
            <td>1.0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>white</td>
            <td>normal forrest or open land without any obstruction</td>
            <td>0.9</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>light green</td>
            <td>slight obstruction</td>
            <td>0.7</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>medium green</td>
            <td>medium obstruction</td>
            <td>0.4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>full green</td>
            <td>strong obstruction</td>
            <td>0.2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>red</td>
            <td>impassable/forbidden</td>
            <td>0.0001</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h5>Gray scale</h5>
    The Blackness defines the velocity. 100% black means a velocity of 1, 0% black means a velocity of 0 (0.0001 used for calculation reasons).
    Values &gt; 95% are treated as roads. (See <a href="#idVelocityCalculator">velocity calculator)</a>
    <h4 id="idModelResolution">Resolution and Steps</h4>
    <p>
        The resolution
        <img src="Resolution.png" style="margin-top: 0px" />
        defines the distance between two grid points of the calculation model.
        The resolution must be reasonable small (0.5m for sprint), otherwise some relevant features like impassable walls may be ignored, which can lead to wrong routes.
        The smaller the resolution, the longer takes the calculation time (in square relation).
    </p>
    <p>
        Steps
        <img src="Steps.png" style="margin-top: 0px" />
        defines, which connections to neighboring points are calculated.<br />
        The default option is, that all connections to points &lt;= Sqrt(5) * resolution are calculated.
        Further options are only horizontal/vertical or horizontal/vertical/diagonal.
    </p>
    <h4 id="idVelocityCalculator">Velocity Calculator</h4>
    <p>
        The predefined velocity calculator is called TvmCalc (Terrain-Velocity-Model-Calculator) and
        defines the velocity at a point based on the velocity model,
        the slope based on the height model and ascent in running direction, also based on the height model.<br />
        For velocities &gt; 0.95 in the velocity model, TvmCalc assumes a road and neglects the slope of the terrain. This leads to a higher runners velocity.<br />

    <p>
        Programmers can define a custom velocity calculator by implementing the interface <code>Grid.Lcp.ITvmCalc</code> and loading the generated type

        or defining custom code (c#)<br />
