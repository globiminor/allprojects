    <h3 id="idCourseFile">Course File</h3>
    <p>
        Any OCAD Course setting file can be used as Course file. Supported OCAD Version include OCAD 8 to OCAD 2018.<br />
        A course Setting file can by either defined by typing the file name or using browser<br />
        <img src="SelectCourseFile.png" />
    </p>
    <p>
        After a course setting file is selected, the courses defined in the file are ready for selection in the course dropdown list
        <br />
        <img src="SelectCourse.png" /><br />
        When a course gets selected, OCourse starts to interpret the corresponding course definition of the OCAD Course.<br />
        For most cases, the sections correspond to the OCAD-interpretation.<br />
        The course is displayed in the <b id="idSectionDisplay">section display</b> and the <a href="#idSectionTable">section table</a>.
        (The section table is explained in the <a href="./Calculation.html#idCalculationModel">calculation model section)</a>
        <br />
        <img src="CourseSimpleSections2.png" /><br />
        In some special cases, OCourse extends the interpretation of OCAD. For example, if a butterfly section is defined in OCAD,
        OCourse automatically finds the different <b id="idVariation">variations</b> and displays them. Each found variation is displayed with a letter combination in the sections table.<br />

        <br />
    </p>
    <h4>Part Selection</h4>
    <p>
        When you press the mouse button on one control and move the mouse while pressed
        to another control in the sections display, the statistics are displayed for the corresponding selection<br />
        <img src="ButterflySelecting.png" /><img src="ButterflySelection.png" style="margin-left: 12px" /><img src="ButterflySelectionTable.png" style="margin-left: 12px" />
    </p>
    <p>
        When you <b id="idHoverVariation">hover</b> the mouse over a variation in the sections table, the controls of the variation are displayed as tool tip.<br />
        <img src="SectionTableHover.png" /><br />
        When you <b id="idSelectVariation">select a variation</b> in the sections table, the controls are highlighted in the sections display.<br />
        <img src="SectionTableSelect.png" /><br />
    </p>
    <h4>Relay</h4>
    <p>
        For each leg in a relay course, the possible variations for the leg are displayed in the sections table.
        Additionally, the mean lengths of the legs are displayed in the top of the sections table.
        <br />
        <img src="RelaySections.png" /><img src="RelayTable.png" /><br />
        <a href="#idHoverVariation">Hover</a> and <a href="#idSelectVariation">selecting a variation</a> in the sections table have the same effects as described in part selection.
    </p>
    <h4>One-Man Relay</h4>
    <p>
        Whereas in OCAD, one-man relay is a special mode, OCourse interprets a simple OCAD-course with multiple passages at the start control as one-man relay.<br />

    </p>
    <h3>Permutations</h3>
    <p>
        Permutations are are different possibilities to complete a entire course so, that all sections defined by the course are passed.
        That means, the full distance of the course is the same, but the order of the passed sections may differ.<br />
        OCourse calculates permutations for start numbers so, that the order of the sections between the different permutations differ as much as possible.<br />
        <img src="Permutations.png" />
    </p>
    <table style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 16px">
        <tr>
            <td class="imgNr">1</td>
            <td>Estimated number of permutations of the current course.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="imgNr">2</td>
            <td>
                Current category. If no categories are defined for a course, it's the course name.
                When you change the categorie, Min. Nr and Max. Nr. changes as defined in OCAD.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="imgNr">3</td>
            <td>Min. Nr is the minimum start number to calculate permutations for. Initial value is taken from OCAD.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="imgNr">4</td>
            <td>Max. Nr is the maximumn start number to calculate permutations for. Initial value is taken from OCAD.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="imgNr">5</td>
            <td>Calculate the permutations for the defined start numbers by Min.Nr and Max.Nr</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="imgNr">6</td>
            <td>Export the calculated permutations as simple courses to OCAD courses or text files.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    Each permutation that is calculated is verified that all sections of the corresponding course are passed.<br />
    The calculation works so, that at first, the needed number of permutations are built in a sorted manner.
    After that, the permutations are randomly linked to the start numbers.
    If the course and the start numbers do not change, the random link does not change, either.
    <p>
        The calculated permutations are displayed in the permutation table.<br />

    </p>
    <table style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 16px">
        <tr>
            <td>StartNr</td>
            <td>The linked start number of the permutation.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Index</td>
            <td>The index of the permutation in the list of the sortedly calculated permutations.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Part 1, Part 2, ...</td>
            <td>
                Per start control, a part is defined. Generally, this is a leg for relays / one man relay.<br />
                If you select a part in the permutation table, the corresponding section is highlighted in the <a href="#idSectionTable">section table</a> and the <a href="#idSectionDisplay">section display</a>.
            </td>
        </tr>
