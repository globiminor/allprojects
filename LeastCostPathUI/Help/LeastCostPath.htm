    </strong><span style="font-size: 12pt">Least Cost Path can be used to calculate the
        least cost past from one point on an orienteering map to another.<br />
        There are four different methods to use the functions of least cost path.<br />

            In the user interfaces of OCourse.exe and LeastCostPathUI.exe &nbsp;it is generated
            from a velocity image. This image should be a georeferenced gray scale image. Such
            a georeferenced gray scale image can be produced from OCAD with a specific symbol
            set (see below). Remark : An additional area must be added to the OCAD file, covering
            the entire map area and being in the background, with a gray value corresponding
            to the velocity on normal terrain without obstruction.&nbsp;</span></p>

            black means a relativ velocity of 1, white means a velocity of 0. For least cost
            path calculation, it is sufficient to provide the relativ velocities, because the
            path is independent from the absolute values. Just if you want to know times along
            a path, the absolute values become necessary.</span></p>

    <span style="font-family: Arial" id="VelocityModel"><strong>Cost Model<br />
    </strong>The cost model defines the actual cost need to get from one cell to a neighboring
        cell given base velocity (obstruction) from velocity grid, height change in running
        direction and slope of terrain.<br />
        To use a specific velocity model, define a method corresponding to the delegate
        <span style="font-family: Courier">Grid.StepCostHandler</span> and assign this method
        to <span style="font-family: Courier">LeastCostPath.StepCost</span>.<br />

    <span style="font-family: Arial" id="OCourse"><strong>OCourse.exe</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        OCourse.exe is to analyze entire OCAD-Course files.
        <br />
        <img style="border: 0;" alt="" src="OCourse.png" id="ImgOCourse" /><br />
        <br />
        Setting height model and velocity model is optional. If they are set, a least cost
        path calculation is performed for the selected course and the results displayed
        in the datagrid. Information about the currently calculated section is displayed
        at the bottom of the window.<br />
        The fields of the data grid correspond to the chosen course or the current selection
        in the course window:<br />
        -DirectLKm is the air distance along the course + 10x climb.<br />
        -DirectKm is the air distance along the course.<br />
        -Climb is the climb along the least cost path routes.<br />
        -OptimalLKm is the distance along the least cost path routes + 10x climb.<br />
        -OptimalKm is the distance along the least cost path routes.<br />
        -OptimatC is the cost along the least cost path routes.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Create Scripts</strong> generates a batch file for calculating all the cost
        models. These batch file containes 3 sections:<br />
        - calculating all cost and direction models for all controls<br />
        - calculating all invers cost and direction models for all controls<br />
        - calculating all cost and route models for all sections.<br />
        Each line in the section file can be run individually. So parallizing on computers
        with multiple cpu's can be achieved.<br />
        Remark: For the third section, the first two sections must already be performed.
        <br />
        <strong>Back Calc</strong> performs the least cost calculation for all routes of
        the entire course file in the background.<br />
        <strong>Export</strong> exports the caluclated routes to a shape file.<br />
        <strong>Import</strong> imports calculated routes from a shape file. If the imported
        routes correspond to the routes of the course file, the imported routes are used
        and no calculation is needed.<br />
        <br />
        MouseDown on first control, MouseMove, MouseUp on second control enables
        a button for detailed analyzing of the the selected section. Pressing the the button
        opens a similar control as in <a href="#LcpUIWindows">LeastCostPathUI without Parameters</a>
        with height model, velocity model, resolution, step, step cost, start point and end point set corresponding to
        the settings in OCourse.exe.</span><p>
